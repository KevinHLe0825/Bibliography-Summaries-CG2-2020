abstract = { Creating realistic physically-based systems such as weather, water, or light for digital environments (DEs) is an important topic in computer graphics. This paper describes a method utilizing compute shaders to implement dynamic manipulation of meshes to realistically simulate how loosely packed snow, or other transformable surfaces, behave when it is stepped on or otherwise manipulated by objects or agents in a VE. Additional features of the method include accumulation over time, wind direction, and other phenomena that serve to facilitating the simulation. Conditions of the environment were tested using physically-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents walking and running around the VE, leaving behind trails in the snow, to assess computational efficiency and robustness. Results show that the system is robust and computationally efficient running at +30 frames per second (FPS) with up to 100 agents under various conditions. Visual inspection of imagery which was captured during the tests also indicates possibilities in creating larger areas in which the snow has been altered in realistic human-like patterns.},

abstract = { We present a novel algorithm for physics-based real-time facial animation driven by muscle deformation. Unlike the previous works using 3D finite elements, we use a 2D shell element to avoid inefficient or undesired tessellation due to the thin structure of facial muscles. To simplify the analysis and achieve real-time performance, we adopt real-time thin shell simulation of [Choi et al. 2007]. Our facial system is composed of four layers of skin, subcutaneous layer, muscles, and skull, based on human facial anatomy. Skin and muscles are composed of shell elements, subcutaneous fatty tissue is assumed as a uniform elastic body, and the fixed part of facial muscles is handled by static position constraint. We control muscles to have stretch deformation using modal analysis and apply mass-spring force to skin mesh which is triggered by the muscle deformation. In our system, only the region of interest for skin can be affected by the muscle. To handle the coupled result of facial animation, we decouple the system according to the type of external forces applied to the skin. We show a series of real-time facial animation caused by selected major muscles that are relevant to expressive skin deformation. Our system has generality for importing new types of muscles and skin mesh when their shape or positions are changed. },

abstract = {The design of lighting in Computer Graphics is directly derived from cinematography, and many digital artists follow the conventional wisdom on how lighting is set up to convey drama, appeal, or emotion. In this paper, we are interested in investigating the most commonly used lighting techniques to more formally determine their effect on our perception of animated virtual characters. Firstly, we commissioned a professional animator to create a sequence of dramatic emotional sentences for a typical CG cartoon character. Then, we rendered that character using a range of lighting directions, intensities, and shading techniques. Participants of our experiment rated the emotion, the intensity of the performance, and the appeal of the character. Our results provide new insights into how animated virtual characters are perceived, when viewed under different lighting conditions.},

abstract = {Current quadratic smoothness energies for curved surfaces either exhibit distortions near the boundary due to zero Neumann boundary conditions or they do not correctly account for intrinsic curvature, which leads to unnatural-looking behavior away from the boundary. This leads to an unfortunate trade-off: One can either have natural behavior in the interior or a distortion-free result at the boundary, but not both. We introduce a generalized Hessian energy for curved surfaces, expressed in terms of the covariant one-form Dirichlet energy, the Gaussian curvature, and the exterior derivative. Energy minimizers solve the Laplace-Beltrami biharmonic equation, correctly accounting for intrinsic curvature, leading to natural-looking isolines. On the boundary, minimizers are as-linear-as-possible, which reduces the distortion of isolines at the boundary. We discretize the covariant one-form Dirichlet energy using Crouzeix-Raviart finite elements, arriving at a discrete formulation of the Hessian energy for applications on curved surfaces. We observe convergence of the discretization in our experiments.},

abstract = {Lighting has been used to enhance emotion and appeal of characters for centuries, from paintings in the Renaissance to the modern-day digital arts. In VFX and animation studios, lighting is considered as important as modelling, shading, or rigging. Most existing work focuses on either empirical best-practice created by artists of the centuries or on lighting perception with basic shapes. In contrast, our work focuses on the effect of lighting on emotional characters. Our study presents an extensive set of novel perceptual experiments designed to investigate the effects of brightness levels (key light brightness) and the proportion of light intensity illuminating the two sides of a character’s face (key-to-fill ratio). We are particularly interested in the effect of lighting on the recognition of emotion, emotion intensity, and the overall appeal, as these are crucial factors for audience engagement. Our results have implications for artists and developers wishing to increase the appeal and emotional expression of their characters, ranging from cartoon to realistic styles. Our key finding is that lighting can be used to effectively alter the intensity of emotion of a character and that brighter conditions increased appeal across all of our experiments.},

We evaluate the ray reordering techniques in the context of the wavefront path tracing using the RTX trace kernels. We show that ray reordering yields significantly higher trace speed on recent GPUs (1.3 − 2.0 \texttimes{}), but to recover the reordering overhead in the hardware-accelerated trace phase is problematic.},

abstract = {Light propagation in scenes with translucent objects is hard to model efficiently for interactive applications. The inter-reflections between objects and their environments and the subsurface scattering through the materials intertwine to produce visual effects like color bleeding, light glows and soft shading. Monte-Carlo based approaches have demonstrated impressive results but are computationally expensive, and faster approaches model either only inter-reflections or only subsurface scattering. In this paper, we present a simple analytic model that combines diffuse inter-reflections and isotropic subsurface scattering. Our approach extends the classical work in radiosity by including a subsurface scattering matrix that operates in conjunction with the traditional form-factor matrix. This subsurface scattering matrix can be constructed using analytic, measurement-based or simulation-based models and can capture both homogeneous and heterogeneous translucencies. Using a fast iterative solution to radiosity, we demonstrate scene relighting and dynamically varying object translucencies at near interactive rates.},

abstract = { Understanding the effects of environmental features such as visual realism on spatial memory can inform a human-centered design of virtual environments. This paper investigates the effects of visual realism on object location memory in virtual reality, taking account of individual differences, gaze, and locomotion. Participants freely explored two environments which varied in visual realism, and then recalled the locations of objects by returning the misplaced objects back to original locations. Overall, we did not find a significant relationship between visual realism and object location memory. We found, however, that individual differences such as spatial ability and gender accounted for more variance than visual realism. Gaze and locomotion analysis suggest that participants exhibited longer gaze duration and more clustered movement patterns in the low realism condition. Preliminary inspection further found that locomotion hotspots coincided with objects that showed a significant gaze time difference between high and low visual realism levels. These results suggest that high visual realism still provides positive spatial learning affordances but the effects are more intricate. },

abstract = {Creating animated virtual AR characters closely interacting with real environments is interesting but difficult. Existing systems adopt video see-through approaches to indirectly control a virtual character in mobile AR, making close interaction with real environments not intuitive. In this work we use an AR-enabled mobile device to directly control the position and motion of a virtual character situated in a real environment. We conduct two guessability studies to elicit user-defined motions of a virtual character interacting with real environments, and a set of user-defined motion gestures describing specific character motions. We found that an SVM-based learning approach achieves reasonably high accuracy for gesture classification from the motion data of a mobile device. We present ARAnimator, which allows novice and casual animation users to directly represent a virtual character by an AR-enabled mobile phone and control its animation in AR scenes using motion gestures of the device, followed by animation preview and interactive editing through a video see-through interface. Our experimental results show that with ARAnimator, users are able to easily create in-situ character animations closely interacting with different real environments.},
