abstract = { Creating realistic physically-based systems such as weather, water, or light for digital environments (DEs) is an important topic in computer graphics. This paper describes a method utilizing compute shaders to implement dynamic manipulation of meshes to realistically simulate how loosely packed snow, or other transformable surfaces, behave when it is stepped on or otherwise manipulated by objects or agents in a VE. Additional features of the method include accumulation over time, wind direction, and other phenomena that serve to facilitating the simulation. Conditions of the environment were tested using physically-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents walking and running around the VE, leaving behind trails in the snow, to assess computational efficiency and robustness. Results show that the system is robust and computationally efficient running at +30 frames per second (FPS) with up to 100 agents under various conditions. Visual inspection of imagery which was captured during the tests also indicates possibilities in creating larger areas in which the snow has been altered in realistic human-like patterns.},

abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPUs) have been widely applied for high-performance applications, however, the performance bottleneck is the data movement from the limited physical memory. The cost of data swapping in/out significant affects the applications' performance under memory oversubscription. We propose memory contention-aware priority assignment and virtual memory management to reduce the performance degradation caused by memory contention and memory thrashing in this study. The performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated using a series of workloads and a case study, and impressive results were obtained.},

abstract = { We present a novel algorithm for physics-based real-time facial animation driven by muscle deformation. Unlike the previous works using 3D finite elements, we use a 2D shell element to avoid inefficient or undesired tessellation due to the thin structure of facial muscles. To simplify the analysis and achieve real-time performance, we adopt real-time thin shell simulation of [Choi et al. 2007]. Our facial system is composed of four layers of skin, subcutaneous layer, muscles, and skull, based on human facial anatomy. Skin and muscles are composed of shell elements, subcutaneous fatty tissue is assumed as a uniform elastic body, and the fixed part of facial muscles is handled by static position constraint. We control muscles to have stretch deformation using modal analysis and apply mass-spring force to skin mesh which is triggered by the muscle deformation. In our system, only the region of interest for skin can be affected by the muscle. To handle the coupled result of facial animation, we decouple the system according to the type of external forces applied to the skin. We show a series of real-time facial animation caused by selected major muscles that are relevant to expressive skin deformation. Our system has generality for importing new types of muscles and skin mesh when their shape or positions are changed. },

abstract = {The design of lighting in Computer Graphics is directly derived from cinematography, and many digital artists follow the conventional wisdom on how lighting is set up to convey drama, appeal, or emotion. In this paper, we are interested in investigating the most commonly used lighting techniques to more formally determine their effect on our perception of animated virtual characters. Firstly, we commissioned a professional animator to create a sequence of dramatic emotional sentences for a typical CG cartoon character. Then, we rendered that character using a range of lighting directions, intensities, and shading techniques. Participants of our experiment rated the emotion, the intensity of the performance, and the appeal of the character. Our results provide new insights into how animated virtual characters are perceived, when viewed under different lighting conditions.},

abstract = {Current quadratic smoothness energies for curved surfaces either exhibit distortions near the boundary due to zero Neumann boundary conditions or they do not correctly account for intrinsic curvature, which leads to unnatural-looking behavior away from the boundary. This leads to an unfortunate trade-off: One can either have natural behavior in the interior or a distortion-free result at the boundary, but not both. We introduce a generalized Hessian energy for curved surfaces, expressed in terms of the covariant one-form Dirichlet energy, the Gaussian curvature, and the exterior derivative. Energy minimizers solve the Laplace-Beltrami biharmonic equation, correctly accounting for intrinsic curvature, leading to natural-looking isolines. On the boundary, minimizers are as-linear-as-possible, which reduces the distortion of isolines at the boundary. We discretize the covariant one-form Dirichlet energy using Crouzeix-Raviart finite elements, arriving at a discrete formulation of the Hessian energy for applications on curved surfaces. We observe convergence of the discretization in our experiments.},
